*💳 Credit Card Fraud Detection* <br><br>
*📌 Overview*<br>
Credit card fraud poses significant financial challenges worldwide. This project aims to develop a machine learning model capable of identifying fraudulent credit card transactions, thereby assisting financial institutions in mitigating losses and protecting customers.

**🚀 Approach & Technologies Used <br><br>
🧠 Machine Learning Models** <br>
*Logistic Regression*: Serves as a baseline model for binary classification.

*Decision Trees:* Captures non-linear patterns in transaction data.

*Random Forest:* An ensemble method enhancing prediction accuracy.

*Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM):* Focuses on hard-to-classify cases to improve performance.

*XGBoost:* An optimized implementation of GBM, known for efficiency.

*🗂 Dataset*<br><br>
*Source:* The dataset comprises credit card transactions labeled as fraudulent or legitimate.

*Preprocessing Steps:* <br>

*Data Cleaning:* Handling missing values and duplicates.

*Feature Scaling:*  Standardizing numerical features to a uniform scale.

*Class Imbalance Handling:* Techniques like SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) are employed to address the imbalance between fraudulent and legitimate transactions.

*📊 Model Training & Evaluation* <br><br>
*Training Process:* Models are trained on the preprocessed dataset, with hyperparameter tuning performed to optimize performance.

*Evaluation Metrics:*

✅ Accuracy

✅ Precision

✅ Recall

✅ F1-score

✅ Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC-ROC)

These metrics provide a comprehensive assessment of the model's ability to detect fraudulent transactions accurately.

*🔍 Key Findings & Challenges* <br>
*Performance:* Ensemble methods, particularly Random Forest and XGBoost, demonstrated superior performance in distinguishing fraudulent transactions.

*Challenges:* The primary challenge is the significant class imbalance, with fraudulent transactions representing a tiny fraction of the data. Additionally, ensuring the model generalizes well to unseen data is crucial to prevent overfitting.

*🔧 Installation*
To set up the Credit Card Fraud Detection project locally:

*# Clone the repository*
git clone https://github.com/SSHarshitha/Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection.git
cd Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection

*# Install dependencies*
pip install -r requirements.txt
🚀 Usage
After installation, you can utilize the trained model to predict the likelihood of transactions being fraudulent. Here's a basic example:

python
Copy
Edit
from model import predict_fraud
import pandas as pd

# Load transaction data
transaction = pd.read_csv('path_to_transaction.csv')

# Prediction
result = predict_fraud(transaction)
print(f"Prediction: {'Fraudulent' if result else 'Legitimate'}")
